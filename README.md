# CPU_Scheduler_Simulator
A CPU scheduling simulator for comparing different scheduling algorithms




This is an assignment for the Operating Systems (COP4610) class at Florida Atlantic University (FAU)
The assignment consists in buildling a simulator, in which three cpu scheduling algorithm will be run (First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First, and Multilevel Feedback Queue).
After the simulation, the average time, turnaround time, and response time of all processes will be comprared between the three algorithms

# How to test

1. Clone the repository at https://github.com/thiagogvasc/CPU_Scheduler_Simulator.git
2. Make sure Python is installed and added to the path environment variable
3. Run 'python main.py' on the command line
